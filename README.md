# Google Search Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview 

This project focuses on analyzing Google Search Trends using the PyTrends API.
The main objective is to understand how people search for different topics over time and across regions.

## Key Highlights:
  •	Data Extraction
     Collected real-time Google Trends data using the PyTrends library.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
     Identified the most searched keywords, search popularity over time, seasonal trends, and regional interest.
	•	Visualization:
    Created interactive and static charts using Matplotlib, Pyplot and Seaborn for better insights and storytelling.

## Skills & Tools Used:
  •	Python Libraries: PyTrends, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
	•	Data Analysis: Time-series analysis, trend detection, data preprocessing
	•	Visualization: Line plots, bar charts, heatmaps for regional comparison

## Problem Statement 
   This project uses Google Trends data (via PyTrends) to analyze keyword search trends globally.

   The tasks covered:
    1. Search analysis by changing only the keyword (dynamic keyword support).
    2. Identify top 15 countries where the keyword is searched most, along with visualization.
    3. Plot a world map showing the countries with maximum search interest.
    4. Extract and visualize time-wise interest to show how the keyword trended in different years.
    5. Compare related keywords and visualize their trends.
